# Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP)

The measurements were taken with the instrument SIP Fuchs III (Radic Research).
All settings and data are saved in files with the ending .res
The original files contained several measurements (readings) and were, however, so long that we extracted the main parts into single files named group1WA_gneiss.res or group1WA_ore.res etc.

We basically measured on two locations

- Gneiss (the fresh one, only group 2 measured on the weathered one) with sticked EKG electrodes
- Ore (on the ore vein, )

The distance of the four electrodes was 10cm (photos could be used to model the geometry in more detail).
We measured two different arrays (quadrupoles of current injection in A-B and voltage measurement through M-N):

- Wenner-alpha (WA) A-M-N-B: k = 2 pi / (1/1a-1/2a-1/2a+1/1a) = 2pi a
- Wenner-beta (WB)  B-A-M-N: k = 2 pi / (1/1-1/2-1/2+1/3) = 6 pi a = 3*k(WA)

In the data files, the geometric factor of WB was used, which means that it is wrong for WA by a factor of 1/3.
Here, we will only share and process the Wenner (WA) data.
