# MineShaft_Geophysics

In the MSc course *Geophysical Experiments in the University's Mine Shaft*, we use geophysical methods in the university's own teaching and research mine shaft "Reiche Zeche". In total, four experiments are carried out:

- seismic tomography of a pillar
- gravity effects of the mine shaft building
- borehole DC resistivity profiling
- spectral induced polarization (SIP) in-situ

This repository holds material for 

- background slides
- task to fulfil for the report
- data and additional information
